## What is Bundler?

A bundler is a development tool that combines many JavaScript code files into a single one that is production-ready loadable in the browser.  

* What are Tranformers?  
Transformers enable you to write larger, reusable, blocks of JavaScript code that can be referenced anywhere in the app.

## What is npm?

npm is a package manager for the JavaScript programming language maintained by npm, Inc. npm is the default package manager for the JavaScript runtime environment Node.js. It consists of a command line client, also called npm, and an online database of public and paid-for private packages, called the npm registry.

## What is yarn?

Yarn is one of the main JavaScript package managers, developed for the Node. js JavaScript runtime environment. An alternative to the npm package manager

## Caret ^ vs Tilda ~

NPM versions are written using three dots separated numbers the first number from the left shows the major release and the second number from the left shows the minor release and the third number shows the patch release of the package.

````python
    Major.Minor.Patch
 ````

### 1. Tilde (~) notation

* It is used to match the most recent patch version. Tilde ~ notation freezes the major version and minor version. As we know patch updates are bug fixes thatâ€™s why we can say ~ notation allows us to automatically accept bug fixes.

* Note: Patch updates are very small security changes in a package that is why the ~version is approximately equivalent to the version.

### 2. Caret (^) notation

* It is used for automatically updating the minor updates along with patch updates.

## Dependency vs DevDependency

### Dependencies

* Packages required by your application in production.

### DevDependencies

* Packages that are only needed for local development and testing.

## Package-lock.json

package-lock. json is a file that is automatically generated by npm when a package is installed. It records the exact version of every installed dependency, including its sub-dependencies and their versions.

## crossorigin and integrity

### cross-origin

A cross-origin request is a request for a resource (e.g. style sheets, iframes, images, fonts, or scripts) from another domain.

### integrity

The integrity attribute allows a browser to check the fetched script to ensure that the code is never loaded if the source has been manipulated.

## What is Parcel?

Parcel. js is an open-source bundler. It supports many popular languages like Typescript and SASS, and can also handle file types like images and fonts. Parcel comes with a few extra tools built-in: a development server, diagnostics, minification, and even image compression.

## Igniting a First App

1.First initialize a project and create the package. json file by the command.  

```html
    npm init /
    npm init -y
```

2.Answer the question of command line

```node
package name: (day2)
version: (1.0.0)
description: 'This is Day2'
entry point: (index.js)
test command: jest
git repository:
keywords:
author: Ayan Khan

```

3.Install a bundler to ignite our app which is parcel as devDependency

```node
    npm install -D parcel/
    npm install --save-dev parcel
```

* You should add node_modules in .gitignore bcoz we have package-lock.json which can again install each and everything

## Install React and React-DOM

After installing parcel we need to install react and react-dom to ignite our app.

```javascript
    npm i react
    npm install react-dom
```

## To run application

To run application with parcel:

```js
    npx parcel index.html
```

## Import React and ReactDOM in JS file

Before we were using CDN link of React and ReactDom but now we install it in our project so we have to import in our JS file

```js
    import React from "react";
    import ReactDOM from "react-dom/client";
```

In our Index.html file we also have to set the js file of type module because browser doesn't understand import statement in normal js file

```html
    <script type="module" src="App.js"></script>
```

## Parcel along with other packages Properties

* Hot Module Replacement (or HMR) is one of the most useful features offered by webpack/parcel/vite. It allows all kinds of modules to be updated at runtime without the need for a full refresh

* HMR uses File Watcher Algorithm --> written in C++
* It bundles our code
* It MINIFY
* Cleaning our Code
* Handles Dev and Production Build
* Super Fast build Algorithm
* Compresses Image
* Caching while development
* Compressing Code
* Compatible with older version of browser
* It adds polyfills
  * A polyfill is a piece of code (usually JavaScript on the Web) used to provide modern functionality on older browsers that do not natively support it.
* HTTPS on dev
* Manages port Number
* Consistent Hashing Algorithm
* Zero Config
* Transitive Dependencies --> One package depend upon another dependency

### .parcel-cache folder

* Stores information about your project when parcel builds it, so that when it rebuilds, it doesn't have to re-parse and re-analyze everything from scratch
* We should put .parcel-cache in .gitignore

### dist folder

The /dist folder contains the minimized version of the source code. The code present in the /dist folder is actually the code which is used on production web applications

### BUILD

## Browserlist

```json
    "browserlist": [
        "defaults and supports es6-module"
    ]
```
